            <ol>
                <li><b>Applications and program development : </b> Development of software and systems includes the technologies that you deal with every day. For instance, the internet browser that you use to view any thing is considered a program. and the programming languages which is used in it : C, C#, c++, d, java,Swift, Td, Visual Basic  </li>
                <li><b>Artificial intelligence development :</b> Artificial intelligence or related fields involve creating interactions of the character in computer games, portions of decision-making programs, chatbots and more, and the programming languages which is used in it : AIML, C, C#, c++, Prolog, Python </li>
                <li><B>Database development :</B> A database is a huge quantity of digital stored information. With optimum speed and minimal processing expense it can be searched, referenced, compared, changed or otherwise manipulated, and the programming languages which is used in it : DBASE FoxPro, MySQL, SQL, Visual FoxPro</li>
                <li><b>Game development :</b> Game programming includes developing computer games or other software for entertainment. The game is a software code designed to entertain or inform an individual. Video gaming is a big business today, and there are millions of different computer games which people of all ages enjoy, and the programming languages which is used in it : C, C#, C++, DarkBASIC, Java</li>
                <li><B>Computer drivers or other hardware development :</B> Computer drivers and programming hardware interface support are a necessity for hardware functionality, Hardware is best described as any physical component of a system containing a circuit board, ICs or other electronics, Your computer would not exist without any hardware, and software could not be utilized, and the programming languages which is used in it: Assembly, C</li>
                <li><B>Internet and web page development</B> : The development of the Internet and the web pages is the basis of the Internet. Without developers there will be no Internet, and the programming languages which is used in it : HDML, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, XML</li>
                <li><b>Script development</b> : A script or scripting language is a programming language that comprises a set of commands inside a file that can be executed without compiling, and the programming languages which is used in it : AutoHotkey, awk, bash, Batch file, Perl, Python, Tcl</li>
