              <p>A programming language is the language used by computer programmers to develop software programs like: scripts, or other sets of computer instructions to execute.  <br>
              the Languages that are used by programmers to write code are named high-level languages. This code can be compiled into a low-level language,Â which the computer hardware understands directly.
                High-level languages are designed for easy reading and understanding. This allows programmers to naturally write source code, using logical words and symbols, High-level languages, for example, include C++, Java, Perl, and PH. </p>
              
                <p> Assembly and machine languages are included in the low-level languages. A language of assembly includes a set of simple instructions, which is much harder to read than a high-level language
                ,The assembly code can be translated into machine code using an assembler. The machine code, or machine language, contains a series 
                of binary codes that a computer's Processor understands (CPU) directly, It needs to be noted that the machine language is not meant to be readable and understandable.
